# USER MANUAL

CSC2510 Final Project — DeelTech User-Onboarding Automation
System
————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

## 1. Introduction

- The DeelTech Faculty Automation System is a Bash-based tool
    that automates the process of gathering faculty names from
    the Tennessee Tech Computer Science department website and
    creating local Ubuntu user accounts for each professor.
- This manual explains how to run the program, how each
    feature works, and what a user needs to know to operate the
    scripts successfully.
————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

## 2. Requirements

```
● An active internet connection
● This program was tested and optimized for
○ Ubuntu 24.
○ Bash 5.2.21+
○ An x86 system
● curl, grep, sed, and awk are installed
● sudo access (required for creating system users)
● A valid license key provided by the admin or a license
file generated by the program and stored in
“etc/csc_user_mgmt”
```
- In the terminal in the directory you have the scripts,
    please make sure to run the following command to make sure
    the scripts are in executable mode:


chmod +x *.sh
————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

## 3. Program Components

- The project is divided into four main parts:
    1. Web Scraper — downloads CS faculty webpage
    2. Parser — extracts clean names from the webpage
    3. User Creation Engine — generates usernames/passwords
       and creates Ubuntu accounts
    4. License System — validates the license before the
       program can be used and during the program's use.
- All scripts are stored in the same project directory.

## 4. Using the Program

### 4.1 Running the Program

- To start, execute the command
    sudo bash ./interface.sh
- You will see:
    ==== DeelTech Faculty Portal ====
    1) Scrape + Parse (default)
    2) Scrape only
    3) Parse only
    4) Create users from names list
    5) Manually create a user


```
6) Exit
```
### 4.2 Scraping Names

- To select scraping and parsing type choose option 1:
    1) Scrape + Parse
- This will:
    ● Download the TTU CS faculty page
    ● Parse out faculty names
    ● Save them into: data/names.txt
- You can also run the steps individually by choosing
    options 2 and 3.

### 4.3 Bulk User Creation

- After names have been scraped and parsed, choose
    option 4:
       4) Create users from names list
- The system will read each line from names.txt, extract
    the first and last name, and automatically create a
    user account.
       Username format: first.last
       Password format: firstnamelastnameDEELTECH
- If a user already exists, the script will skip them.

### 4.4 Manual User Creation

- The manual user tool allows you to add one user at a
    time, by selecting:
       5) Manually create a user
- The script will ask for:


```
● First name (letters only)
● Last name (letters only)
```
- It will then generate the username and password using
    the same format as the bulk creator.

## 5. License System

- Before any menu actions can run, the program requires a
    valid license.
- There are two ways the license can be provided:
    **1. A valid .dat license file in: /etc/csc_user_mgmt/**
    **2. Entering a 16-digit key on first run**
- The key is securely encrypted by a one way hashing
    algorithm along with a base64 salt.
    If the key is valid, a license file is created
    automatically and stored in the license directory.
- Without a valid license, the program will not run any
    features.
    _Note: The admin also has a separate script (license.sh) for_
    _generating keys and license files._
————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

## 6. Troubleshooting

```
“faculty.html not found”
```
- Run scraping again: ./web-scraper.sh


```
“No names.txt found”
```
- Scrape + parse before selecting the automatic creation
    of users.
**User creation fails**
- Ensure you are running the program with sudo:
sudo bash ./interface.sh
**License error**
- Verify that:
● You entered the correct 16-digit key.
● That there is a license.dat file in path
“etc/csc_user_mgmt”
————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

## 7. Summary

- This project automates:
    ● Retrieving faculty names
    ● Cleaning name data
    ● Generating credentials
    ● Creating Ubuntu system users
    ● Enforcing license validation
- The scripts are modular and can be run individually or
    through the main menu. The system reduces manual account
    creation time and demonstrates core DevOps automation
    principles.
